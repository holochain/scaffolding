This is a headless skeleton for a hApp. 

The `ui` directory is empty; you are expected to add your frontend there if you still intend to include one.

Note that the scaffolding cli does not generate UI components for this template.

- For setting up a frontend, you can use a build tool such as vite:

  cd {{app_name}}
  npm create vite@latest ./ui

- Ensure your UI's local dev server port is set using the UI_PORT environment variable from the root package.json.
- Update the "network"{{#if holo_enabled}} and "network:holo"{{/if}} script in the root package.json to include your ui's start script.
- Add a "package" script in your ui/package.json that builds and creates a zip archive of all files in the directory in ui. Update the root package.json "package"  script to include it.
