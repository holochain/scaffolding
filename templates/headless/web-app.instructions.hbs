This is a headless skeleton for a hApp. 

To build the app you can run

  cd {{app_name}}
  {{(package_manager_command package_manager "install" null)}}
  {{(package_manager_command package_manager "build:happ" null)}}

The ui directory is empty; you are expected to add your frontend there if you still intend to include one.

Note that the scaffolding cli does not generate ui components for this template.

- To set up your frontend, you can use a build tool such as vite:

  {{(package_manager_command package_manager "create vite@latest ./ui" null)}}

- Ensure your ui's local dev server port is set using the UI_PORT environment variable from the root package.json.
- Update the "network"{{#if holo_enabled}} and "network:holo"{{/if}} script in the root package.json to include your ui's start script.
- Update the "package" script in the root package.json to include a script that builds your ui and creates a zip archive of the build artifacts.
- Set the ./workdir/web-happ.yaml file's "ui.bundled" field to the zip archive path
