## Environment Setup

> PREREQUISITE: set up the [holochain development environment](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/).

Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

```bash
nix develop
{{(package_manager_command package_manager "install" null)}}
```

**Run all the other instructions in this README from inside this nix shell, otherwise they won't work**.

## Running 2 agents
 
```bash
{{(package_manager_command package_manager "start" null)}}
```

This will create a network of 2 nodes connected to each other and their respective UIs.
It will also bring up the Holochain Playground for advanced introspection of the conductors.

## Running the backend tests

```bash
{{(package_manager_command package_manager "test" null)}}
```

## Bootstrapping a network

Create a custom network of nodes connected to each other and their respective UIs with:

```bash
AGENTS=3 {{(package_manager_command package_manager "network" null)}}
```

Substitute the "3" for the number of nodes that you want to bootstrap in your network.
This will also bring up the Holochain Playground for advanced introspection of the conductors.

## Packaging

To package the web happ:
``` bash
{{(package_manager_command package_manager "package" null)}}
```

You'll have the `{{app_name}}.webhapp` in `workdir`. This is what you should distribute so that the Holochain Launcher can install it.
You will also have its subcomponent `{{app_name}}.happ` in the same folder`.
